# Datting_match_prediction
we are going to predict the outcome of a specific speed dating session based on the profile of two people, so we can implement a recommendation system to better match people in speed dating events. We did have another online dating dataset (Tinder-like) but that one is super dirty which requires extensive cleaning, so we do this one instead.
